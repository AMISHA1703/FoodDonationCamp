"I am creating a platform where you can donate edible items left over from your children's meals for every hungry person within a 2-kilometer range around you. I understand it won't work right away as there's still much to be done, and it's not very user-friendly yet.

I want everyone to come together to build a platform where we can upload leftover food in our vicinity, ensuring that every hungry person can find a meal if someone is willing to help. The website requests three photos: two for the food available and two for the home, helping identify those in need within a 2-kilometer radius.

Having such a platform would allow us to inform those sleeping hungry on the streets about available food nearby within a 2-kilometer range and the number of people in each home who have meals left."
